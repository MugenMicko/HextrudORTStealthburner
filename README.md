Modification on HextrudORT Mount for Stealthburner to suit certain needs

The base HextrudORT Mount for Stealthburner is not my work, there are multiples of this online claimed as their own.  My modifications to this are to adapt CANbus Mounts to the system and make this as low profile as I can.  This will facilitate 17mm Nema 14 motors, and will not support 20mm motors.  I will adapt this to 20mm motors if required by enough people.  The design supports 3 points of mounting for the CANboard mount to stiffen the connection and attempt to prevent eroneous Y axis vibration in use of the inbuilt ADXL and give a true result for input shaper.  The CANboard mount also includes 2 points of screw mount and an additional 2 points of contact to reduce vibration in the board induced by mounting systems.  Take this all with a grain of salt and your milage may vary.  Intially designed arount FLYSHT36 V1 and the recto modded for FLYSHT36 V2.
